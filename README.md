# extract_time_blk_bz2_py

The main reason for this project was to learn Python.
As I've spent a lot of time on understanding how bzip2 works at my previous C project with the same [name](../extract_time_blk_bz2), I've decided to do the same in Python. As a result, it works much more slower (as expected) than C version.
