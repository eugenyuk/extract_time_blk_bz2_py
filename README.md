# extract_time_blk_bz2_py

The main reason for this project was to learn Python.
Previously, I've spent a lot of time on learning how bzip2 works doing my previous C project with the same [name](https://github.com/eugenyuk/extract_time_blk_bz2). I've decided to do the same in Python. As a result, it works much more slower (as expected) than C version.

TODO:
implement multi processing module to speed up program execution
